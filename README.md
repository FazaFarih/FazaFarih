## Hallo I'm Faza 👋
I'm a Web Development enthusiast currently studying Informatics at Telkom University.

Fueled by curiosity and a strong desire to grow, I’m passionate about building functional and responsive websites that bring real value to users. I enjoy learning about modern development tools and best practices, and I believe continuous learning is essential in tech.

I'm currently exploring front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, while also learning the basics of back-end development. With every project, I aim to improve both my problem-solving skills and my ability to create clean, efficient code.
